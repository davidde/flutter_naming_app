// - MyAppState defines the data the app needs to function.

// - It extends `ChangeNotifier`, which means that it can notify others about its own changes.
//   For example, if the current word pair changes, some widgets in the app need to know.
// - The state is created and provided to the whole app using a `ChangeNotifierProvider`
//   (see code above in MyApp). This allows any widget in the app to get hold of the state.
